                    My name is Biruk Yoseph, and I graduated in computer
                    engineering during my academic career. I explored how
                    algorithms and data structures can be optimized for
                    large-scale applications and have a solid background in
                    computer programming and web technology. I am especially
                    interested in the role of front-end development. I like
                    products that are attractive and modern. I can handle
                    projects from steps 1 to 2 while working alongside a
                    co-worker as a developer.
